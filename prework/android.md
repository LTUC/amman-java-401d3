The Android team at Google provides excellent documentation and guides for learning Android development.

Follow through their initial guide to build your first Android app. The guide gives you instructions to set up Android Studio, configure Java and the Android SDK, configure an emulator, write your first app and see it running.

Work through the 5 sections below **Build your first app** on this guide page, from **Overview** through **Start another activity**.

## Submitting Your Work

Take a picture of your Android application running on your emulator, or running on a physical phone, and submit it to Canvas.
