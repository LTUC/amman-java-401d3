# Project Week: Domain Model, Databases, Deployment

## Domain Model, Databases, Deployment
[ ] Create Java classes that represent all the information you're trying to track.
[ ] Create database tables that correspond to each Java class you're trying to store
[ ] Build tables and columns to represent 1:M and M:M relations between
    tables in the database.
[ ] Create Java classes that interact with the database that perform CRUD operations
    on each of the Java classes.
[ ] Deploy your code base to GitHub
[ ] Create an Organization to represent your team and make sure all team members
    have access to create branches, push and pull from the repo.
[ ] Deploy a bare-bones version of your app to Heroku so you're sure it's online
    from day one and can contribute changes to there throughout the rest of the
    week.
